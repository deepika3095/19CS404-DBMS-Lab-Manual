# Experiment 1: Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

## 🎯 Objective:
To understand and apply the concepts of ER modeling by creating an ER diagram for a real-world application.

## 📚 Purpose:
The purpose of this workshop is to gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that visually represent the structure of a database including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

---

## 🧪 Choose One Scenario:

### 🔹 Scenario 1: University Database
Design a database to manage students, instructors, programs, courses, and student enrollments. Include prerequisites for courses.

**User Requirements:**
- Academic programs grouped under departments.
- Students have admission number, name, DOB, contact info.
- Instructors with staff number, contact info, etc.
- Courses have number, name, credits.
- Track course enrollments by students and enrollment date.
- Add support for prerequisites (some courses require others).

---

### 🔹 Scenario 2: Hospital Database
Design a database for patient management, appointments, medical records, and billing.

**User Requirements:**
- Patient details including contact and insurance.
- Doctors and their departments, contact info, specialization.
- Appointments with reason, time, patient-doctor link.
- Medical records with treatments, diagnosis, test results.
- Billing and payment details for each appointment.

---

## 📝 Tasks:
1. Identify entities, relationships, and attributes.
2. Draw the ER diagram using any tool (draw.io, dbdiagram.io, hand-drawn and scanned).
3. Include:
   - Cardinality & participation constraints
   - Prerequisites for University OR Billing for Hospital
4. Explain:
   - Why you chose the entities and relationships.
   - How you modeled prerequisites or billing.

## Entities and Attributes:

### STUDENT

* Stu_id (PK)  
* Full_name  
* DOB  
* Phone_no  
* Email  
* FK: Prog_id  

### PROGRAM

* Prog_id (PK)  
* Prog_name  
* FK: Dept_ID  

### ENROLLMENT

* Enroll_ID (PK)  
* Enrollment_date  
* FK: Stu_id  
* FK: Course_id  

### COURSE

* Course_id (PK)  
* Course_name  
* Credit  
* FK: Prog_id  
* FK: Instructor_id  

### DEPARTMENT

* Dept_ID (PK)  
* Dept_name  

### INSTRUCTOR

* Instructor_id (PK)  
* Name  
* Phone_no  
* Email  
* FK: Dept_ID  

## Relationships and Constraints:

### Relationships

* STUDENT — PROGRAM: Many to One  
* PROGRAM — DEPARTMENT: Many to One  
* STUDENT — COURSE: Many to Many (via ENROLLMENT)  
* COURSE — INSTRUCTOR: Many to One  
* INSTRUCTOR — DEPARTMENT: Many to One  
* PROGRAM — COURSE: One to Many  
* DEPARTMENT — INSTRUCTOR: One to Many  

### Cardinality & Constraints

* A student registers for exactly one program.  
* A program belongs to one department.  
* Each course is part of one program.  
* Each course is taught by one instructor.  
* Each instructor belongs to one department.  
* A student can enroll in many courses, and a course can have many students (via ENROLLMENT).  
* Enrollment entity holds the enrollment date and links a student to a course.  

## Extension (Optional Enhancements):

### Schedule Entity (Optional)

#### New Entity: SCHEDULE

* Attributes: ScheduleID (PK), Instructor_id (FK), Day, StartTime, EndTime  

#### Relationship:

* One Instructor → Many Schedules  

### Justification:

* Allows capturing detailed time availability per instructor.  

## Design Justification:

### Entity Choices and Justifications

#### STUDENT

* Captures individuals pursuing education.  
* Attributes ensure identity, contact, and academic mapping.  

#### PROGRAM

* Represents the academic track a student is enrolled in.  
* Linked to departments for structural clarity.  

#### COURSE

* Academic units under programs.  
* Tied to instructors and enrollments.  

#### ENROLLMENT

* Resolves the many-to-many between students and courses.  
* Tracks course enrollment events.  

#### DEPARTMENT

* Groups instructors and programs.  
* Simplifies academic administration.  

#### INSTRUCTOR

* Faculty or teaching staff.  
* Linked to courses and departments.  

## RESULT

Successfully designed an ER diagram for the University Academic System with entities, relationships, constraints, and optional enhancements to support real-world academic operations.
